👋 Hello, I'm Marta 

👩🏻‍💻 I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Business Management and an MBA in Information Systems and Entrepreneurship.

I have more than 12+ years of experience in the IT and telco industry, and now I'm a business analyst & product owner.

As a product owner, I'm a critical thinker and problem solver, I analyze business needs, understand stakeholder issues, identify opportunities to improve digital transformation projects and explain difficult concepts so that it is understood by everyone.

🚀 "Be the person you needed when you were younger" is one of my favorite quotes, so I'm a mentor focused on boosting women's careers in technology.

Since I have a little passion for digital marketing, I volunteer as a social media manager at the "As Raparigas do Código".

💕 I really love sharing my knowledge, so probably you will find me talking about #tecnology, #steam, #it, #digital, and #business.
